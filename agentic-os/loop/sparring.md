# Sparring (BUILD 7 — optional)
INSTALL WHEN: you ship code daily. Builder and breaker, opposed; neither
touches the other's output; disputes go to you.

breaker (daily):
  /loop 1d [breaker] Read yesterday's merged diffs. Write ONE failing test
  exposing a real weakness. Commit under tests/sparring/ tagged @sparring.
  Fix nothing. Solid code = say so, write nothing.

builder (daily):
  /loop 1d [builder] If any @sparring test fails, fix the CODE until it
  passes. Never edit, weaken, or delete a sparring test; disputes queue for me.
